    <p>Once upon a time there was a boy named Tamer in Codeerburg. He dreamed of becoming the best web developer. One
        stormy day, panic broke out: lightning struck the central router and the entire village was without internet.
        Tamer saw this as an opportunity. He created an offline page with HTML, CSS and JavaScript full of games and
        riddles. He proudly spread the page throughout the village by selling USB sticks.</p>
    <p>The villagers were enthusiastic and enjoyed Tamer's creation. The offline page became a hit, even outside
        Codeerburg. Tamer became a hero and proved that valuable creations are possible without internet. He became the
        most important person in Codeerburg and lived happily ever after.</p> <br>
    <p style="margin-top: -10px;">En dit, allemaal zonder internet!</p>

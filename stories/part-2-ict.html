    <h1>Email from Cloudwise</h1>
    <p>Hello there, I received a message on April 12th after science class. The message asked if I could come to room 307, but I actually ran into the IT guy in the hallway. He asked if I would like to have a tour at Cloudwise. I thought that would be really cool and said yes. Here's the message. (I removed all sensitive and private information because I don't want any issues.)
    <br>My name is [Name] and I am responsible for the [Position] within Cloudwise. (I removed the name and position so that you can't identify who it is, and yes, it should appear professional.)
    <br>Thank you for reporting the irregularities with monitoring. (Which I did using the extension blocker and tab hider.) This module has of course been in existence for a number of years, and we see that especially with regard to GDPR and the increasingly tech-savvy digital student (me ðŸ˜Ž), we urgently need to make some adjustments. We are aware of this and are already actively working on it. We expect to have these issues resolved before the new school year.
    <br>We are thrilled with how this was handled by you, and I would like to invite you and the student to come to our office. In addition to a tour at Cloudwise, the student can explain to our developers what he has done, what tools he has used, and the developers can ask questions.
    <br>This would have a dual purpose. For our developers, it would raise awareness that in the development of our software, we need to be increasingly savvy and assume that students are becoming more and more driven with software development and, of course, will try everything to bypass the school's tools. The second would be to give recognition to the achievement of this student.
    <br>I would like to hear your thoughts on this (the 'you' here is the IT guy from my school) and whether you are interested in coming to take a look behind the scenes at Cloudwise. Best regards,
    <br>And for those who have used these tools in class, thanks! Without you, this would not have happened (probably). Peace âœŒ</p>

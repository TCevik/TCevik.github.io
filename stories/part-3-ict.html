    <h1>Visit to Cloudwise</h1>
    <p>Hello, and here I am for the 3rd and final time about my visit to Cloudwise! Let me start at the beginning, I entered and was immediately greeted warmly :).
    <br>
    <br>Once inside, we went straight to the lunchroom, where we chose a table and had a chat. I explained who I was, what I had done, etc.
    <br>
    <br>After a brief conversation, we started the tour. We walked and walked (yes, really, we didn't fly ðŸ˜‚). What I found very nice and creative is that they have given each room a name (and some also a theme). Some of those names were Pineapple, Willie Wonka where the ideas were created, and a gym in the theme of... you wouldn't be able to guess, a GYM!
    <br>
    <br>At the end of the tour, we stopped at a room, and the gentleman from Cloudwise went to get some people. Then the Cloudwise employees introduced themselves. After that, I told and showed them how I did all of this, how I found it. Really, the Chromebook I was using then was slower than a turtle with a jetpack on a skateboard. But that doesn't matter because ðŸŒŸit workedðŸŒŸ!
    <br>
    <br>Then we went to the lunchroom and had a sandwich. I had a sandwich with egg. That was also the moment I received the GOLDEN TICKET. I could use it to get an internship at Cloudwise on a date and time of my choice. I also received: Cloudwise chocolate, Cloudwise ping pong game, Cloudwise speakers, Cloudwise keychain, and a bag to hold it all (see photo below â‡©)

    <br>P.S.: There was also someone from Cloudwise who had read this series, so if that person sees this: HELLOOO ðŸ‘‹! Well, that was part 3 about IT. Have a great day and I hope you don't stub your little toe against the table!</p>

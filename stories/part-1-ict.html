    <h1>Conversation at School</h1>
    <p>Hello, on Wednesday, March 29, 2023, I was asked to have a conversation with someone who works in the IT department at my school.
    <br>I was told that they find it very impressive how I have done this. It was also mentioned that it has its pros and cons. For some students who are not doing so well and want to do things that are not allowed, it can be very tempting to use this. This may cause them to not pay attention in class and learn what they need to learn.
    <br>So, this site is not useless. If you found it useful, you can continue using it and new things will keep being added!
    <br>If you have any questions, just come to me at school or send me a message on Discord/WhatsApp (if you have my number).</p>

    <h3>Use of Tools:</h3>
    <p>On this site, you’ll find various handy tools that are free to use.  
        <br>The use of these tools is entirely up to you. It’s important to understand that any issues at, for example, school or work resulting from the use of these tools are not Tamer’s responsibility.  
        <br>Consider the following scenario:  
        <br>
        <br><strong>Wrong:</strong>  
        <br>Pietje uses the hz-generator to produce a bell sound during class to leave early. Tamer is unfairly blamed and has to stay after school, even though he had nothing to do with it. <span class="error">[WRONG]</span>

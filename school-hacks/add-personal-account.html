    <h1>This is how you can add a personal account, even if the browser or computer doesn't allow it</h1>
    
    <h3>Method 1</h3>
    <p>To begin, you need to disconnect the connection between your Chromebook and Chrome. You can do this by going to chrome://settings/signOut (the 'O' must be capitalized) and sign out. Then, restart Chrome. Go to <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?hl=en&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&ec=GAlAmgQ&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=AddSession">this link</a> to add an account (you can do this multiple times).</p>

    <h3>Method 2 (this is not what you think so follow the steps until the end!)</h3>
    <p>Step 1: First, you need to disconnect the connection between your Chromebook and Chrome by:
    <br>1. Go to settings of your Chromebook using the gear icon on this screen alt + shift + s.
    <br>2. Go to the apps tab > Google Play Store > Manage Android Preferences.
    <br>3. Go to accounts and click on your school email > Google account.
    <br>4. Scroll to the right until you reach the Security tab.
    <br>5. Scroll down and click on Manage all devices.
    <br>6. Choose the Chromebook you are currently logged into, which is usually the one with the most recent time. (DO NOT CHOOSE YOUR CURRENT SESSION! THIS WON'T WORK!) If you are unsure which device to select, log out of all Chromebooks you see there!
    <br>7. If you get a notification stating that your SESSION, REALLY S E S S I O N (not account action required) has expired, you have logged out of the correct device. Do not click on it!
    <br>Step 2: (You only need to perform the previous steps once unless you restart your Chromebook) Go to <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?hl=en&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&ec=GAlAmgQ&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=AddSession">this link</a> to add an account (you can do this multiple times).</p>

    <h3>Method 3</h3>
    <p>Step 1: First, you need to disconnect the connection between your Chromebook and Chrome by:
    <br>1. Go to the Google app on your phone.
    <br>2. Go to your accounts and select your school account.
    <br>3. Tap on all your accounts again and go to "Manage your Google Account."
    <br>4. Scroll to the right until you reach the Security tab.
    <br>5. Scroll down and click on "Manage all devices."
    <br>6. Choose the Chromebook you are currently logged into and want to log in with your personal account, which is usually the one with the most recent time. If you are unsure which device to select, log out of all Chromebooks you see there!
    <br>7. If you get a notification on your Chromebook stating that your SESSION, REALLY S E S S I O N (not account action required) has expired, you have logged out of the correct device. Do not click on it!</p>
    <br>Step 2: (You only need to perform the previous steps once unless you restart your Chromebook) Go to <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?hl=en&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&ec=GAlAmgQ&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=AddSession">this link</a> to add an account (you can do this multiple times).

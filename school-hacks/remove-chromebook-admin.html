    <h1>Chromebook Management Removal Tutorial:</h1>
    <p>If you have a Chromebook that is managed by an organization with 'Forced Enterprise' management, you cannot simply remove the administrative settings without cooperation from the administrator. This is because the administrator has control over the Chromebook and must grant permission to make changes.</p>
    <p>If you still want to restore the Chromebook to its original settings, you can try the following steps:</p>
    <p>1- Turn off the Chromebook.
    <br>2- Press and hold the 'Esc', 'Refresh', and 'Power' keys simultaneously.
    <br>3- Release the keys when the screen displaying the message 'Chrome OS is missing or damaged' appears.
    <br>4- Press ctrl + d and follow the instructions on the screen to restore the Chromebook to its original settings.
    <br>5- If these steps do not work, you cannot remove it yourself like I can. Contact the organization's administrator to see if they can remove the administrative settings or unlock the Chromebook.</p>
    <p>Actually, it's not true that you can't remove it yourself, because soon you definitely can. ðŸ˜ˆ</p>

    <h1>Tam-exploit: Disabling Chrome Extensions Without Permanent Removal</h1>
    <h3>This is no longer possible at MY school, maybe it is at yours. Give it a try, I would say!</h3>
    
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        - A Chromebook.
        <br>- A spy extension.
        <br>- Brains, but most don't have those! ðŸ˜‚
    </p>

    <h3>Step 1: Identify the extension ID</h3>
    <p>Find the extension you want to disable and copy the 32-character ID of the extension.
    <br>You can find the ID in chrome://extensions and then the extension you want to crash in the url after chrome://extensions/?id=[ID IS HERE] or in chrome://extensions-internals.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 2: Open an extension page</h3>
    <p>Go to the URL chrome-extension://extension-id/manifest.json (replace "extension-id" with the actual ID of the extension).
    <br>This will open a page belonging to the extension you want to disable.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 3: Create bookmarks</h3>
    <p>Create three bookmarks: one for the extension page (bookmark A), one for chrome://kill (bookmark B), and one for chrome://hang (bookmark C).</p>
    
    <h3>Step 4: Disable the extension</h3>
    <p>While on the extension page (bookmark A), click on the chrome://kill bookmark (bookmark B). This should crash the page. Now quickly proceed to step 5.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 5: Act quickly</h3>
    <p>Immediately after the page crashes, start spamming the chrome://hang bookmark (bookmark C) and reload the page by clicking the refresh button.
    <br>You have to keep spamming bookmark C for about 5 seconds.
    <br>You need to reload the page within one or two seconds of the crash.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Flex in class until it's fixed</h3>
    <p>You can now test if it has crashed by clicking bookmark A, it should keep loading indefinitely or click on the extension icon and nothing happens. You might need to try it a few times.</p>

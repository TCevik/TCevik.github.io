    <h1>Extension Stopper</h1>
    <h3>This is no longer possible at MY school, maybe it is at yours. Give it a try, I would say!</h3>
    
    <h3>Tutorial:</h3>
    <p>1. Put the code below in your bookmarks:
    <br>javascript:let shim = false;var ids = prompt("Extension ids (created by Tamer Ã‡evik)").split(",");setInterval(()=>{ids.forEach((id)=> opener.chrome.developerPrivate.updateExtensionConfiguration({extensionId: id, fileAccess: shim}));shim = !shim;}, 145);
    <br>2. Go to chrome://extensions (open a new tab and search for that EXACTLY!)
    <br>3. Copy the ID of the extension you want to stop (you can find it by clicking "Details" on the extension you want and then the part in the URL after /?id=
    <br>Find an extension where it says: "View in Chrome Web Store" (it doesn't have to be from the extension you want to stop)
    <br>4. Click on it and spam the esc key as fast as you can (if you see a white or black (depends on your theme) page and the name of the tab is Untitled, it's good)
    <br>5. Then click on the bookmark you made in step 1
    <br>6. Paste the ID in there and click OK
    <br>7. Keep the Untitled tab and Extensions - ................. tab open, otherwise it won't work</p>

    <h3>Tips:</h3>
    <p>Turn off 'Memory saving' on your chromebook! (LINK: chrome://settings/performance)</p>
    <p>If the extension keeps moving or flashing all the time, it's working. (sometimes it stops for a moment, then you have to switch to the 'Untitled' tab)</p>

    <h1>DNS Unblock</h1>
    <p>I've got something fun for you,
    <br> 
    <br>1. You log out (ctrl + shift + q [2x]).
    <br>2. You go to a WiFi network where you can change the name servers, such as the guest network (just search in the WiFi settings).
    <br>3. Go to "Network" ==> "Custom Name Servers" and fill in this IP in all the fields. 52.207.185.90 (this may disappear sometimes but eventually it will work).
    <br>4. Then click on "Login" at the top next to the "Forget" button.
    <br>5. Click on the blue text, not the yellow button, and DONE!</p>

    <p>If this gets patched, you can always reset your laptop with "esc" + "refresh" + "power" and do it there in the WiFi configuration before logging in!</p>

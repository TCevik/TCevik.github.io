    <h1>Downgrade Your Chromebook</h1>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>Chrome OS recovery images come in a .zip file.
    <br>Chrome OS recovery images come in a .zip file.
    <br>You will need:
    <br>USB stick with at least 8 GB storage
    <br>Chromebook Recovery Utility / DD (*NIX)</p>

    <h3>Downloading a Recovery Image</h3>
    <p>Go to the list of recovery images on this website: <a href="https://chrome100.dev/">Chrome100</a>
    <br>Scroll or use CTRL + F to find your board name
    <br>Click "See more"
    <br>Click one of the "Download" links</p>

    <h3>Finding the Right Recovery Image</h3>
    <p>Recovery images are made for individual Chromebook boards. To download the correct recovery image, you need to find your Chromebook's board name.
    <br>To find your board name, go to the (built-in) website chrome://version and look for the "Platform:" row.
    <br>It should look something like this:
    <br>15329.59.0 (Official Build) stable-channel octopus
    <br>The word (in bold) after "stable-channel" is your board name. The Chromebooks at my school are called "octopus".</p>

    <h3>Burning the Zip File to a USB Chromebook Recovery Utility</h3>
    <p>Open the Chromebook Recovery Utility
    <br>Click the gear icon in the top right of the window and select "Use local image"
    <br>Navigate to the .zip recovery image you downloaded.
    <br>Select your USB drive as prompted by the window.
    <br>Now select create.</p>

    <h3>Restoring Chrome OS from the USB Stick</h3>
    <p>Press ESC + ⟳ + ⏻ to open the recovery menu.
    <br>Connect your USB drive that you just burned a recovery image to.
    <br>Press enter once the menu is finished verifying the USB drive.
    <br>When finished, disconnect the USB drive.</p>

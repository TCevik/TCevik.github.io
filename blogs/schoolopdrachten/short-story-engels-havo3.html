            <h1>From Screen Time to Survival Time</h1>
            <p>Tamer, a computer kid, spent countless hours using his screen. He'd even built his own website, TC_tam, a website with  digital fun for him and his brother Piet. But then, disaster struck: the power went out! What started small became bigger than expected. Hours became days, then weeks. Months went by and the electricity was still out. Tamer and Piet, sad and bored, decided to take matters into their own hands. They went to the power plant to fix the issue…</p>
            
            <h3>Chapter 1 - The discovery</h3>
            <p>Once they came to the power plant they saw something weird. There was no one around. They thought it was a bit strange that no one was there, they expected that there were people working to fix the power, but no. What were they supposed to do? They had an idea, their father worked at Alliander, which is an electricity company. So maybe he could fix the electricity. Tamer immediately called him. But what they had not taken into their plan is that there is no electricity. So they couldn't call at all. But this is not the biggest problem. Tamer's phone was also dead! What were they supposed to do? They did not know where they were and therefore could not return home. It was starting to become evening. They could hardly see anything anymore. They had to quickly find a place to sleep. Fortunately, they quickly found a place under a bridge where it was reasonably warm. They just went there to sleep because they didn't have much choice.</p>
            
            <h3>Chapter 2 - The next morning</h3>
            <p>Tamer woke up and decided to check out the area a bit. He walked a few laps around their sleeping spot, each a little bigger. Piet also woke up 10 minutes later. He thought Tamer had been kidnapped or something! He started shouting 'TAMER WHERE ARE YOU?'. Tamer heard him scream and quickly ran back to their sleeping place. Piet was happy that Tamer was back. “I thought you were kidnapped,” Piet said. 'No, of course not, otherwise you would have heard it, right?'. “Yes, maybe,” said Piet. They put away their things and continued to find their way home. That just didn't go quite as expected. Tamer climbed onto a roof and sprained his ankle coming off. Piet didn't know what to do. He had no phone and no others to help them. They were also in the middle of the forest. 'Who makes an electricity house in the FOREST, come on?' said Piet. Well anyway they continued walking, Tamer was in a bit of pain but hey, that's the only way to get out of here alive. They found a crazy old house where they could spend the next night. But that's the best thing that happened during the time they got lost, because as soon as it started to get dark, dangerous animals arrived.</p>
            
            <h3>Chapter 3 - The worst of all</h3>
            <p>It was getting dark so they had to go to sleep. It was very dangerous in this house. They had no idea whose it was or what would happen, well they don't care because they're just going to sleep, they had to do something. They went to sleep not knowing that they would be woken up at 3 a.m. by a bear demolishing their house. They were terrified and thought this would be the end of their lives. They had to fight the bear, they grabbed everything they could get and started hitting the bear as hard as they could. Finally the bear gave up and ran away. They were so happy that they had defeated the bear, they went back to sleep and woke up the next morning. They woke up and all their stuff had been stolen. They couldn't believe their eyes. How could this have happened?! How were they ever going to survive this? They had almost nothing left, no phone, no food. All they had were clothes and a lighter that Tamer still had in his pocket. Luckily they still had the lighter because they desperately needed it to stay warm.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the house was completely destroyed and they had to find another place to sleep. They immediately started looking for another hiding place. They found one further in the woods. Next to a river and a bridge. They understood if this could become their homebase, they would be in a much better position. So they started building. Piet made a hole in the ground so they were out of the wind and Tamer looked for branches to make the walls. The hole was already getting big and Piet asked how big it should be. Tamer thought it was big enough and started making the walls from branches and leaves.</p>
            <p>It became a very cool and big house. Now let's hope that another bear doesn't come… They finished the house after 3 - 4 hours and went looking for food. They couldn't really find anything, it was also the first time that they had to survive in the woods. It was very tiring for them, but they kept doing what they were doing.</p>
            
            <h3>Chapter 4 - The quest</h3>
            <p>They went to check out the power plant again, that was their original idea. They arrived and went inside. It was completely overgrown with plants! It seems like this building had been empty for 2000 years, but that wouldn't be possible because the power was still working 2 weeks ago. But what Tamer found among all the rubble was the real savior. He found a device that still had power. He used his coding skills to write software that can send radio signals to get help. He spent about 2 hours writing the best possible software. The only problem is that they still needed an antenna, and now also batteries because the device turned off 5 seconds after he finished the software. That was really lucky or really bad luck. They didn't really care, if only they could get out of there.</p>
            <p>So, they had to find an antenna and batteries. In search of the supplies for their antenna project, they collected two aluminum rods of 75 centimeters each. The rods were placed in line with each other, ready to serve as a base for the antenna. Then the center core of the coaxial cable was carefully attached to the end of the top rod. The ground of the coaxial cable found its place at the bottom rod, completing the circuit. They found the supplies in a small house next to the power plant. But they did have to do a lot of assignments for it. </p>
            <p>There was a scary man with a long beard, a hat and a black coat in the house who said he knew where to get the materials for their antenna. All they had to do was walk across a 10 meter long beam to the other side while there was lava underneath. So they had to risk their lives or they had no antenna and stayed in the forest forever. They knew it, they were going to try. They walked very carefully across the beam to the other side. Piet fell! Fortunately, Tamer was able to quickly grab him to save him. Phew, that almost went wrong. Luckily they found the materials for the antenna on the other side and they were able to continue their adventure.</p>
            <p>Now just add the batteries and they're done! Unfortunately, night came again and they were able to test out their self made house. They went back quickly, sat by the campfire for a while and then went to sleep.</p>
            
            <h3>Chapter 5 - Does it work?</h3>
            <p>They woke up and immediately realized something: they needed to find batteries. They left their house and walked back into the woods.</p>
            <p>Tamer, the tech engineer, wanted to find something electrical to break open, hoping for batteries inside. But they only found old music boxes with dust and twisty wires. They felt exhausted.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, Piet tripped on something that was sticking out! It was a metal box in the ground! Tamer brushed off the dirt, he was really curious what was inside. Slowly, he opened the box. Wow! Not batteries, but cool tools! Screwdrivers, a hammer, and even tape! Like a box of fun things!</p>
            <p>But then, in the corner, Tamer saw something even better. There, next to wrenches, were four batteries! Big smiles appeared on their faces, they ran back to their self made house. Tamer held the box tight. He put the batteries in the antenna, really hoping it would work. He pushed the button and... nothing! Boom, their happy feelings went away. Maybe the batteries were dead.</p>
            <p>But then, a soft zapp sound! The antenna lit up with a green light that blinked. Tamer did it! His computer skills saved the day! Now, all they had to do was wait for help or someone to find them.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 6 - Waiting for resque</h3>
            <p>Now they have one more thing to do, and that is wait for someone to come. And will anyone come at all? It wasn't really a good plan to go to the power plant alone. Now they are stuck here and the power is still not working. Because they were so bored, they started doing fun things. They thought for a moment and decided they were going to make a tree house. How were they going to do that? Tamer looked for branches again and Piet started looking for something they could use as a floor. They both went in different directions, Tamer found the branches quickly, but the part for the ground was a bit more difficult, but eventually Piet found a palette. It was very tough but eventually he got to the home base. They made the treehouse and it turned out really cool. It wasn't that high but it was already starting to look like a nice place to live. They could almost continue living here. The only problem is that they had not eaten in 3 days! Hopefully help will come soon. What would their parents think? Their children are suddenly away for 3 days or maybe even longer. "Would they be concerned, or would they be thinking that they are visiting somewhere?" Piet asked. Tamer replied that he had no idea. In any case, they had to wait a little longer. They went to play hide and seek, but not in too large an area because they would lose their way. Piet first hid, he sat behind a tree. Tamer started searching after the 60 second count. What did they hear now? Is that a helicopter?! Help came! But it was already getting dark and the helicopter didn't see them. They just went to sleep and hoped they would be found.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 7 - The rescue</h3>
            <p>The sun began shining through the leaves, waking Tamer and Piet up. They rubbed their eyes and stretched, having a little pain from sleeping on the ground so many times. But then, they heard it again! The sound of a helicopter! They both jumped up, waving their arms wildly, shouting for help. The helicopter circled around and finally spotted them! Their hearts raced with excitement as it came towards them.</p>
            <p>Their mother, tears of relief streaming down her face, stepped out of the helicopter. "Oh my boys, I've been so worried!" she said, hugging them tightly. Tamer and Piet hugged her back, feeling overwhelmed with joy. They climbed aboard the helicopter, feeling happy to be rescued from their adventure in the woods.</p>
            <p>As they flew back home, Tamer and Piet couldn't stop talking about their journey. They laughed about the bear and spoke about their self made treehouse. Their mother listened very intensively, relieved to have them safe and back to her.</p>
            <p>Back home, their father also gave them a hug, relieved to see them home again. Tamer and Piet promised never to go into the woods alone again, realizing the importance of staying safe.</p>
            <p>Safe and sound in their own beds, they fell asleep with grateful hearts, knowing that no matter what adventures they faced, their family would always be there to rescue them.</p>
            <p>They were woken up in the middle of the night by flashing lights. They couldn't believe it, the light came back on! Their father came into their room and said he had fixed it and everything was back to normal. They went back to sleep and lived happily ever after.</p>

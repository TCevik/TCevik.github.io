Hello everyone,

Welcome to the TC_tam site, created by Tamer Ã‡evik.
Here, you can find and use a variety of useful tools.

For instance, if your school blocks certain things, you can use proxies. You can also discover handy bookmarklets for hacking at your school.
Alternatively, if you're not into hacking, you can simply read some stories about me.
And if none of this appeals to you, you can also just play games.

There's plenty to do, and more is being added all the time!

Best of luck!
